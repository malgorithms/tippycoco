### Quicker and easier than Github issues for now

Stuff

- mobile exploration:

  - gameplay can actually be ok on iOS?
  - canvas fill fix
  - redo the menu for touch :-(
  - test on smaller ios + ipad
  - check this page: https://medium.com/appscope/designing-native-like-progressive-web-apps-for-ios-1b3cdda1d0e8

- sharing idea: shareable stats page powered with some persistence / random playerid
- bowling beast 8-ball character
- more characters?
- managed to force the ball through the net once - add constraint
- firefox on mac:
  - controller lag
  - button mappings different from chrome & safari
  - fps sucks
  - warning when controller connected, if bugs not fixable
- performance:
  - explore higher physicsDt / predictionDt
  - consider selective draws on low framerate:
    - no clouds
    - no backshadow on text
  - test on old iMac
- better intro ideas
  - all of them emerging from the ground and looking at character next to them
  - ball follows them out and they watch that
  - they jump back into the ground?
- exiting game shouldn't cause reload
- iOS - can I make it work?!
- better readme page for github
- review all console logging
- basic SEO of landing page
- basic pageview stats?
- better favicon / larger ones for bookmarking
